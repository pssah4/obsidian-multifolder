# Contributing to Multifolder

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Multifolder! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## 🎯 Ways to Contribute

- 🐛 Report bugs
- 💡 Suggest new features
- 📝 Improve documentation
- 🔧 Submit bug fixes
- ✨ Implement new features
- 🧪 Write tests
- 📖 Create tutorials or examples

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Obsidian_Multifolder.git
   cd Obsidian_Multifolder
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 📋 Development Process

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 2. Code Standards

#### TypeScript
- Use strict type checking (already configured)
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` types when possible
- Use async/await for asynchronous code

#### Code Style
- Use tabs for indentation (4 spaces)
- Follow ESLint rules
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

#### Naming Conventions
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/methods: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private members: prefix with underscore `_privateMethod`

### 3. Testing

Before submitting:

```bash
# Check reviewer-facing UI copy style
npm run check:ui-text

# Full local validation
npm run validate

# Optional: install the repo's pre-commit hook once per clone
npm run hooks:install

# Test in Obsidian
# Link plugin to vault and test manually
```

The pre-commit hook is optional but recommended for this repository. It keeps UI copy regressions out of commits by running the UI copy style checker before the commit is created.

### 4. Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages:

```
feat: add support for nested mount points
fix: resolve path separator issue on Windows
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code according to ESLint rules
refactor: simplify path resolution logic
test: add tests for mount point validation
chore: update dependencies
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

3. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue numbers (if any)
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
   - Testing performed

4. **Wait for review** and address feedback
